Install necessary dependencies and python libraries from packages
(for Debian):
% make install-deb

Alternatively, you can install BnW in virtualenv (for Debian):
% make install-venv

Create config file from stub and open it for editing:
% make config

Run BnW:
% make run

Note that installation and configuration of XMPP and HTTP servers
which will be used by BnW are still on your own.
However you can find additional info by reading comments in
config.py.example or looking at this page (in russian):
